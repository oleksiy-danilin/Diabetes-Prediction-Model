This repository contains various experiments conducted using an original dataset focused on factors contributing to diabetes.
The purpose of this collection is to demonstrate proficiency with essential Python packages, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and others, alongside skills in statistical analysis and foundational machine learning (ML).
The experiments included in this repository are as follows:
  1) Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the diabetes dataset.
  2) Hypothesis Testing and Z-Statistic Comparisons to evaluate the significance of key variables.
  3) One-Hot Encoding to create a fully binary dataset for further modeling.
  4) Development and Comparison of Three Predictive Models: logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting.
  5) K-Modes and K-Prototypes Clustering applied to patients, non-patients, and combined datasets.
  
  This repository showcases a combination of data exploration, statistical evaluation, and machine learning techniques to analyze diabetes-related risk factors effectively.
